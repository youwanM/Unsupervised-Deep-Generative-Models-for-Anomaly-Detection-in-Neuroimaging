@article{Bengs2021,
 abstract = {Abstract Purpose Brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) are essential for the diagnosis of neurological diseases. Recently, deep learning methods for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) have been proposed for the analysis of brain MRI. These methods rely on healthy brain MRIs and eliminate the requirement of pixel-wise annotated data compared to supervised deep learning. While a wide range of methods for UAD have been proposed, these methods are mostly 2D and only learn from MRI slices, disregarding that brain lesions are inherently 3D and the spatial context of MRI volumes remains unexploited. Methods We investigate whether using increased spatial context by using MRI volumes combined with spatial erasing leads to improved unsupervised anomaly segmentation performance compared to learning from slices. We evaluate and compare 2D variational autoencoder (VAE) to their 3D counterpart, propose 3D input erasing, and systemically study the impact of the data set size on the performance. Results Using two publicly available segmentation data sets for evaluation, 3D VAEs outperform their 2D counterpart, highlighting the advantage of volumetric context. Also, our 3D erasing methods allow for further performance improvements. Our best performing 3D VAE with input erasing leads to an average DICE score of 31.40\% compared to 25.76\% for the 2D VAE. Conclusions We propose 3D deep learning methods for UAD in brain MRI combined with 3D erasing and demonstrate that 3D methods clearly outperform their 2D counterpart for anomaly segmentation. Also, our spatial erasing method allows for further performance improvements and reduces the requirement for large data sets.},

@article{Raad2023,
 abstract = {Abstract Analysis of 3D medical imaging data has been a large topic of focus in the area of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, though little work has been done in algorithmic (particularly unsupervised) analysis of neonatal brain MRI’s. A myriad of conditions can manifest at an early age, including neonatal encephalopathy (NE), which can result in lifelong physical consequences. As such, there is a dire need for better biomarkers of NE and other conditions. The objective of the study is to improve identification of anomalies and prognostication of neonatal MRI brain scans. We introduce a framework designed to support the analysis and assessment of neonatal MRI brain scans, the results of which can be used as an aid to neuroradiologists. We explored the efficacy of the framework through iterations of several deep convolutional Autoencoder (AE) unsupervised modeling architectures designed to learn normalcy of the neonatal brain structure. We tested this framework on the developing human connectome project (dHCP) dataset with 97 patients that were previously categorized by severity. Our framework demonstrated the model’s ability to identify and distinguish subtle morphological signatures present in brain structures. Normal and abnormal neonatal brain scans can be distinguished with reasonable accuracy, correctly categorizing them in up to 83\% of cases. Most critically, new brain anomalies originally missed during the radiological reading were identified and corroborated by a neuroradiologist. This framework and our modeling approach demonstrate an ability to improve prognostication of neonatal brain conditions and are able to localize new anomalies.},

@article{Behrendt2023,
 abstract = {The use of supervised deep learning techniques to detect pathologies in brain MRI scans can be challenging due to the diversity of brain anatomy and the need for annotated data sets. An alternative approach is to use unsupervised anomaly detection, which only requires sample-level labels of healthy brains to create a reference representation. This reference representation can then be compared to unhealthy brain anatomy in a pixel-wise manner to identify abnormalities. To accomplish this, generative models are needed to create anatomically consistent MRI scans of healthy brains. While recent diffusion models have shown promise in this task, accurately generating the complex structure of the human brain remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a method that reformulates the generation task of diffusion models as a patch-based estimation of healthy brain anatomy, using spatial context to guide and improve reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on data of tumors and multiple sclerosis lesions and demonstrate a relative improvement of 25.1\% compared to existing baselines.},

However, OOD detection in medical imaging remains an open challenge, and we address three gaps: the underexplored potential of a simple OOD detection model, the lack of optimization of deep learning strategies specifically for OOD detection, and the selection of appropriate reconstruction metrics. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a reconstruction-based autoencoder for unsupervised detection of synthetic artifacts in brain MRI. We evaluated the general reconstruction capability of the model, analyzed the impact of the selected training epoch and reconstruction metrics, assessed the potential of model and/or metric ensembles, and tested the model on a dataset containing a diverse range of artifacts. Among the metrics assessed, the contrast component of SSIM and LPIPS consistently outperformed others in detecting homogeneous circular anomalies. By combining two well-converged models and using LPIPS and contrast as reconstruction metrics, we achieved a pixel-level area under the Precision-Recall curve of 0.66. Furthermore, with the more realistic OOD dataset, we observed that the detection performance varied between artifact types; local artifacts were more difficult to detect, while global artifacts showed better detection results. These findings underscore the importance of carefully selecting metrics and model configurations, and highlight the need for tailored approaches, as standard deep learning approaches do not always align with the unique needs of OOD detection.},

 abstract = {Due to the substantial feature extraction and end-to-end learning capability, deep learning has been widely used in intelligent medical image detection. However, amount of parameters in these models relies on the number of labeled training data, which influences the performance. Due to this reason, we propose a novel unsupervised medical image detection model named Multi-Scale Normalizing Flow (MS-NF). First, a fusion backbone network is applied to extract the multi-scale feature maps, which capture the different scale features of the anomalies. Second, normalizing flow transfers the abnormal distribution into the normal distribution hidden in the latent space, which is used for anomaly detection. To further improve the detection performance, channel and spatial convolutional attention mechanisms are integrated to make the model focus on the anomalous region by a shared network. Experimental results obtained on brain tumor MRI and ISIC2018 datasets show that MS-NF improves the pixel-level AUC index by 9\% compared to existing medical image detection models, also performing well on small-scale data with efficient training and inference.},

We present MORPHADE (Morphological Autoencoders for Alzheimer's Disease Detection), a novel unsupervised learning approach which uses deformations to allow the analysis of 3D T1-weighted brain images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of deformations with deep unsupervised learning to not only detect, but also localize and assess the severity of structural changes in the brain due to AD. We obtain markedly higher anomaly scores in clinically important areas of the brain in subjects with AD compared to healthy controls, showcasing that our method is able to effectively locate AD-related atrophy. We additionally observe a visual correlation between the severity of atrophy highlighted in our anomaly maps and medial temporal lobe atrophy scores evaluated by a clinical expert. Finally, our method achieves an AUROC of 0.80 in detecting AD, out-performing several supervised and unsupervised baselines. We believe our framework shows promise as a tool towards improved understanding, monitoring and detection of AD. To support further research and application, we have made our code publicly available at github.com/ci-ber/MORPHADE.},

A plethora of such unsupervised anomaly detection approaches has been made in the medical domain, based on statistical methods, content-based retrieval, clustering and recently also deep learning. Previous approaches towards deep unsupervised anomaly detection model patches of normal anatomy with variants of Autoencoders or GANs, and detect anomalies either as outliers in the learned feature space or from large reconstruction errors. In contrast to these patch-based approaches, we show that deep spatial autoencoding models can be efficiently used to capture normal anatomical variability of entire 2D brain MR images. A variety of experiments on real MR data containing MS lesions corroborates our hypothesis that we can detect and even delineate anomalies in brain MR images by simply comparing input images to their reconstruction. Results show that constraints on the latent space and adversarial training can further improve the segmentation performance over standard deep representation learning.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of unsupervised anomaly segmentation in medical images, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to the expensive pixel-level annotations from experts and the existence of a large amount of unannotated normal and abnormal image scans. We introduce a segmentation network that utilizes adversarial learning to partition an image into two cuts, with one of them falling into a reference distribution provided by the user. This Adversarial-based Selective Cutting network (ASC-Net) bridges the two domains of cluster-based deep segmentation and adversarial-based anomaly/novelty detection algorithms. Our ASC-Net learns from normal and abnormal medical scans to segment anomalies in medical scans without any masks for supervision. We evaluate this unsupervised anomly segmentation model on three public datasets, i.e., BraTS 2019 for brain tumor segmentation, LiTS for liver lesion segmentation, and MS-SEG 2015 for brain lesion segmentation, and also on a private dataset for brain tumor segmentation. Compared to existing methods, our model demonstrates tremendous performance gains in unsupervised anomaly segmentation tasks. Although there is still room to further improve performance compared to supervised learning algorithms, the promising experimental results and interesting observations shed light on building an unsupervised learning algorithm for medical anomaly identification using user-defined knowledge.},

 abstract = {Over the past years, pseudo-healthy reconstruction for unsupervised anomaly detection has gained in popularity. This approach has the great advantage of not requiring tedious pixel-wise data annotation and offers possibility to generalize to any kind of anomalies, including that corresponding to rare diseases. By training a deep generative model with only images from healthy subjects, the model will learn to reconstruct pseudo-healthy images. This pseudo-healthy reconstruction is then compared to the input to detect and localize anomalies. The evaluation of such methods often relies on a ground truth lesion mask that is available for test data, which may not exist depending on the application. We propose an evaluation procedure based on the simulation of realistic abnormal images to validate pseudo-healthy reconstruction methods when no ground truth is available. This allows us to extensively test generative models on different kinds of anomalies and measuring their performance using the pair of normal and abnormal images corresponding to the same subject. It can be used as a preliminary automatic step to validate the capacity of a generative model to reconstruct pseudo-healthy images, before a more advanced validation step that would require clinician's expertise. We apply this framework to the reconstruction of 3D brain FDG PET using a convolutional variational autoencoder with the aim to detect as early as possible the neurodegeneration markers that are specific to dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.},

Unsupervised anomaly detection approaches provide an alternative solution by relying only on sample-level labels of healthy brains to generate a desired representation to identify abnormalities at the pixel level. Although, generative models are crucial for generating such anatomically consistent representations of healthy brains, accurately generating the intricate anatomy of the human brain remains a challenge. In this study, we present a method called masked-DDPM (mDPPM), which introduces masking-based regularization to reframe the generation task of diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and Masked Frequency Modeling (MFM) in our self-supervised approach that enables models to learn visual representations from unlabeled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply MFM in DPPM models for medical applications. We evaluate our approach on datasets containing tumors and numerous sclerosis lesions and exhibit the superior performance of our unsupervised method as compared to the existing fully/weakly supervised baselines.

@article{Simarro2020,
 abstract = {Anomaly detection (AD) is the identification of data samples that do not fit a learned data distribution. As such, AD systems can help physicians to determine the presence, severity, and extension of a pathology. Deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can be exploited to capture anatomical variability. Consequently, any outlier (i.e., sample falling outside of the learned distribution) can be detected as an abnormality in an unsupervised fashion. By using this method, we can not only detect expected or known lesions, but we can even unveil previously unrecognized biomarkers. To the best of our knowledge, this study exemplifies the first AD approach that can efficiently handle volumetric data and detect 3D brain anomalies in one single model. Our proposal is a volumetric and high-detail extension of the 2D f-AnoGAN model obtained by combining a state-of-the-art 3D GAN with refinement training steps. In experiments using non-contrast computed tomography images from traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, the model detects and localizes TBI abnormalities with an area under the ROC curve of {\textasciitilde}75\%. Moreover, we test the potential of the method for detecting other anomalies such as low quality images, preprocessing inaccuracies, artifacts, and even the presence of post-operative signs (such as a craniectomy or a brain shunt). The method has potential for rapidly labeling abnormalities in massive imaging datasets, as well as identifying new biomarkers.},

In the literature, it is common for anomaly detection to rely on analysing the residual image between the subject's image and its pseudo-healthy reconstruction. This approach however has limitations partly due to the pseudo-healthy reconstructions being imperfect and to the lack of natural thresholding mechanism. Our proposed method, inspired by Z-scores, leverages the healthy population variability to overcome these limitations.

Deep learning and especially Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) have shown great potential in the unsupervised learning of data distributions. In principle, this allows for such a check and even the localization of parts in the image that are most suspicious. Currently, however, the reconstruction-based localization by design requires adjusting the model architecture to the specific problem looked at during evaluation. This contradicts the principle of building assumption-free models. We propose complementing the localization part with a term derived from the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence.

 abstract = {Obtaining expert labels in clinical imaging is difficult since exhaustive annotation is time-consuming. Furthermore, not all possibly relevant markers may be known and sufficiently well described a priori to even guide annotation. While supervised learning yields good results if expert labeled training data is available, the visual variability, and thus the vocabulary of findings, we can detect and exploit, is limited to the annotated lesions. Here, we present fast AnoGAN (f-AnoGAN), a generative adversarial network (GAN) based unsupervised learning approach capable of identifying anomalous images and image segments, that can serve as imaging biomarker candidates. We build a generative model of healthy training data, and propose and evaluate a fast mapping technique of new data to the GAN's latent space. The mapping is based on a trained encoder, and anomalies are detected via a combined anomaly score based on the building blocks of the trained model - comprising a discriminator feature residual error and an image reconstruction error. In the experiments on optical coherence tomography data, we compare the proposed method with alternative approaches, and provide comprehensive empirical evidence that f-AnoGAN outperforms alternative approaches and yields high anomaly detection accuracy. In addition, a visual Turing test with two retina experts showed that the generated images are indistinguishable from real normal retinal OCT images.

abstract = {Pathological brain appearances may be so heterogeneous as to be intelligible only as anomalies, defined by their deviation from normality rather than any specific set of pathological features. Amongst the hardest tasks in medical imaging, detecting such anomalies requires models of the normal brain that combine compactness with the expressivity of the complex, long-range interactions that characterise its structural organisation. These are requirements transformers have arguably greater potential to satisfy than other current candidate architectures, but their application has been inhibited by their demands on data and computational resources. Here we combine the latent representation of vector quantised variational autoencoders with an ensemble of autoregressive transformers to enable unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation defined by deviation from healthy brain imaging data, achievable at low computational cost, within relative modest data regimes. We compare our method to current state-of-the-art approaches across a series of experiments with 2D and 3D data involving synthetic and real pathological lesions. On real lesions, we train our models on 15,000 radiologically normal participants from UK Biobank and evaluate performance on four different brain MR datasets with small vessel disease, demyelinating lesions, and tumours. We demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance both image-wise and pixel/voxel-wise, achievable without post-processing. These results draw attention to the potential of transformers in this most challenging of imaging tasks.}

Such discrepancies can inadvertently increase false positive rates and reduce specificity, complicating radiological evaluations. This paper introduces Temporal Harmonization for Optimal Restoration (THOR), which refines the reverse diffusion process by integrating implicit guidance through intermediate masks. THOR aims to preserve the integrity of healthy tissue details in reconstructed images, ensuring fidelity to the original scan in areas unaffected by pathology. Comparative evaluations reveal that THOR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods in retaining detail and precision in image restoration and detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain MRIs and wrist X-rays.

  abstract={Segmentation masks of pathological areas are useful in many medical applications, such as brain tumour and stroke management. Moreover, healthy counterfactuals of diseased images can be used to enhance radiologists' training files and to improve the interpretability of segmentation models. In this work, we present a weakly supervised method to generate a healthy version of a diseased image and then use it to obtain a pixel-wise anomaly map. To do so, we start by considering a saliency map that approximately covers the pathological areas, obtained with ACAT. Then, we propose a technique that allows to perform targeted modifications to these regions, while preserving the rest of the image. In particular, we employ a diffusion model trained on healthy samples and combine Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) at each step of the sampling process. DDPM is used to modify the areas affected by a lesion within the saliency map, while DDIM guarantees reconstruction of the normal anatomy outside of it. The two parts are also fused at each timestep, to guarantee the generation of a sample with a coherent appearance and a seamless transition between edited and unedited parts. We verify that when our method is applied to healthy samples, the input images are reconstructed without significant modifications. We compare our approach with alternative weakly supervised methods on the task of brain lesion segmentation, achieving the highest mean Dice and IoU scores among the models considered.},
